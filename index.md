I am a grad student, pursuing MS in Computer Engineering at [New York University, Tandon School of Engineeering.](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) I am Salman. I was always determined to build a portfolio for myself that protrays diverse and deep technical competencies, engineering skillsets and as well as my leadershsip attributes. I got into engineering because I always loved to take challenges of solving engineering connundrums. My research interests are in the areas of Embedded System Design, Internet of Things (Iot), Signal Processing, Wireless Networking, Sensors and Systems (for biomedical application).  

I graduated from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Malaysia in 2020 with a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical-Mechatronics Engineering.

When I am not working, I love playing chess. I would go extra mile to learn a new opening, or explore new lines based on Stockfish (Neural Network based Chess Engine). You could challenge me on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/salmanR). 
I like writing on random stuffs too. My topics range from anecdotes to fictions to philosophy. I try to write on [medium](https://medium.com/@ssrsyed2).
