#### Need For Speed Wearable Health Tracker

In the past decade we have seen an explosion of wearable health devices ranging from heart rate sensors to step counters to distance trackers. These devices are designed to help us meet our fitness goals and help us keep in good physical shape.
The objective of this project was to build a wearable speedometer which can calculate velocity by measuring angular velocities available
from the built-in gyroscope (L3GD20) in STM32F429 - without a GPS. The gyroscope is able to measure 3-axis angular velocity. Strategically placing the sensor on the legs or feet can capture the angular velocities and with a bit of processing can convert those angular velocities to linear forward velocity and calculate distance traveled (using only a gyro!)
