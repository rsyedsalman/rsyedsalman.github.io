### My story

I was always determined to build a portfolio for myself that protrays diverse and deep technical competencies, engineering skillsets and as well as my leadershsip attributes. I got into engineering because I always loved to take challenges of solving engineering connundrums.


When I am not working, I love playing chess. I would go extra mile to learn a new opening, or explore new lines based on Stockfish (Neural Network based Chess Engine). You could challenge me on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/salmanR). 
I like writing on random stuffs too. My topics range from anecdotes to fictions to philosophy. I try to write on [medium](https://medium.com/@ssrsyed2).
