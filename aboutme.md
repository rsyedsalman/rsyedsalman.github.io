### My story

I always had a strong inclination towards solving problems. In my early high school days, I found my deep love for Chemistry and wanted to pursue a career as an organic chemist. Later, I started hanging out at a friend's dad's lab/workshop where I was introduced to sensors, soldering guns, a multimeter, breadboard and jumpers, and yes an Arduino UNO. I discovered a new love, a new form of problem-solving, tinkering.

I recently discovered a new interest in value investing and valuation. Even though I invest mostly in index funds and ETFs, I like reading about the valuations and financial reports of different companies. 

When I am not working, I love playing chess. I would go the extra mile to learn a new opening or explore new lines based on Engines. You could challenge me on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/salmanR).
